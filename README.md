# PasswordKit
🌑 - Hey! This is my first ever project (that I'm uploading to github) so don't be too harsh on my code.

🪐 - This project was just made for fun and practice, it includes a password strength checker that rates your password on a scale of 0 to 7. Also a password generator which will generate any amount of passwords for you with random characters.

🛸 - I'd really appreciate it if you supported me and this project by starring the project or by forking the project! :)

# Requirements
```py
Python (www.python.org)
Colorama (pip install colorama)

# I may have forget something since I rushed through this, if this is the case try to look in main.py, checker.py and generator.py. By checking each of their imports with an IDE.
```
